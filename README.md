# BattleshipPositions
c++ program to calculate the num of positions possible in battleship

the idea is to create a program that calculates all possible positions of ships in a starting board

big goals currently:
reduce the number of iterations by as much as possible


the final number calculated: 30,093,975,536



next attempt:
try w/o a physical board, just record 2 lists to compare to?
