# BattleshipPositions
c++ program to calculate the num of positions possible in battleship

the idea is to create a program that calculates all possible positions

other stuff
  also put in the ability to enter specific dots(misses), then calculate the number of ways to arrange ships so that there are no hits

big goals currently:
reduce the number of iterations by as much as possible
